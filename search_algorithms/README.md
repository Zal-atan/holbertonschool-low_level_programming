# This is a Readme for the Search Algorithms
## In this project we will learning to work with different search algorithms and finding the efficiency of each one

# Author - Ethan Zalta

## There are 7 tasks in this project


## **Task 0**
*Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

## **Task 1**
*Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

## **Task 2**
*What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?

## **Task 3**
*What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?

## **Task 4**
*What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?

## **Task 5**
*What is the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?

## **Task 6**
*What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?
